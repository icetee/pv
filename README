Introduction
************

This is the README for `pv' ("Pipe Viewer"), a terminal-based tool for
monitoring the progress of data through a pipeline.  It can be inserted into
any normal pipeline between two processes to give a visual indication of how
quickly data is passing through, how long it has taken, how near to
completion it is, and an estimate of how long it will be until completion.


Documentation
*************

A manual page is included in this distribution.  See `man ./doc/quickref.1',
or `man pv' after installation.


Compilation
***********

If you have downloaded `pv' from Subversion, first run "./generate.sh".

To compile the package, type "sh ./configure", which should generate a
Makefile for your system.  You may then type "make" to build everything.
Note that GNU `make' is required; this may be installed as `gmake' on some
systems, so if typing "make" gives an error, try "gmake" instead.

See the file `doc/INSTALL' for more about the `configure' script.

Developers note that you can do "./configure --enable-debugging" to cause
debugging support to be built in, and "--enable-profiling" builds in
profiling support (see "man gprof").  Also note that doing "make index" will
generate an HTML code index (using "ctags" and "cproto"); this index lists
all files used, all functions defined, and all TODOs marked in the code.
